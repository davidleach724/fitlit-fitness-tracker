## Context


#### Technologies used:
  * JavaScript
  * Terminal
  * GitHub
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Dependencies

## Challenges
  * Incorporating new libraries to the project.
  * Planning and organizing the classes properly for this project.
  * Struggled to get enough refactoring done in the first place, and generally done on time.
  * didn't "meet" all our milestone dates, primarily because of how we set them at the beginning, more so than running behind.

## Wins
  * TTD, chai-testing library and mocha-framework set up.
  * Project planning and organization
  * Array prototype methods
  * Use of dependency of `chart.js`
  * Practice OOP while creating the application
  * Using the project board * issues to keep track of the progress.

## Future Goals
  * Add an Admin view, which will display the views of data from all users.
  * Incorporate a dynamic calendar that the user can interact with it !

## In Action

#### Take 1
* When the user is opens the application using the browser, the user can see the navigation bar that displays the "challenge of day". The user also has the opportunity to choose to display the information from 5 different users using the drop down menu. On the right side of the navigation bar, the user can also display old data by choosing a different date from the menu of dates.
